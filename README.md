# HTCdaskGateway

* A Dask Gateway client extension for heterogeneous cluster mode combining the Kubernetes backend for pain-free scheduler networking, with COFFEA-powered HTCondor workers and/or OKD [coming soon].
* Latest [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/htcdaskgateway.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/htcdaskgateway)
 is installed by default and deployed to the COFFEA-DASK notebook on EAF (https://analytics-hub.fnal.gov). A few lines will get you going!
* The current image for workers/schedulers is: ccoffeateam/coffea-dask-almalinux8:2024.4.0-py3.10

## Basic usage @ Fermilab [EAF](https://analytics-hub.fnal.gov)
* Make sure the notebook launched supports this functionality (COFFEA-DASK notebook)

```
from htcdaskgateway import HTCGateway

gateway = HTCGateway()
cluster = gateway.new_cluster()
cluster

# Scale my cluster to 5 HTCondor workers
cluster.scale(5)

# Obtain a client for connecting to your cluster scheduler
# Your cluster should be ready to take requests
client = cluster.get_client()
client

# When computations are finished, shutdown the cluster
cluster.shutdown()
```
## Other functions worth checking out
* This is a multi-tenant environment, and you are authenticated via JupyterHub Oauth which means that you can create as many* clusters as you wish
* To list your clusters:
```
# Verify that the gateway is responding to requests by asking to list all its clusters
clusters = gateway.list_clusters()
clusters
```
* To connect to a specific cluster from the list:
```
cluster = gateway.connect(cluster_name)
cluster
cluster.shutdown()
```
* To gracefully close the cluster and remove HTCondor worker jobs associated to it:
```
cluster.shutdown()
```
* There are widgets implemented by Dask Gateway. Make sure to give them a try from your EAF COFFEA notebook, just execute the the `client` and `cluster` commands (after properly initializing them) in a cell like: 
```
-------------
cluster = gateway.new_cluster()
cluster
< Widget will appear after this step>
-------------
client = cluster.get_client()
client
< Widget will apear after this step >
-------------
cluster
< Widget will appear after this step >
```
